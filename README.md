The goal of this project is to explore and compare different clustering methods: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.

To achieve this, the project follows these steps:

Understanding Clustering Methods: Reviewing the principles and characteristics of K-means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering.

Clustering Implementation: Applying the three clustering algorithms to the dataset and generating meaningful groupings.

Evaluation and Comparison: Analyzing and comparing the results obtained from each clustering method.

By the end of the project, we aim to identify which clustering technique provides the most insightful groupings for the given dataset.
